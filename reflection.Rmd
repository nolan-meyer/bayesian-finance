## Acknowledgements

For our project, we want to thank Dr. Alicia Johnson for teaching us a lot of useful knowledge about Bayesian Statistics. Moreover, Dr. Alicia Johnson has given us a ton of feedback, and helped us through all the difficulties we have encountered. It has been a challenging project and we would not have been able to do it without the tools and techniques she taught us throughout this semester.
