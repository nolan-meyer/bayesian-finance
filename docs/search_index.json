This information was scraped from Yahoo Finance in November of 2021, and collected in a csv format for data analysis. To collect the data, first, we got the list of the current 500 S&amp;P companies from Slickchart (https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500). After having the list of the companies, we then moved on to the financials information of the listed companies on yahoo finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/) to get the metrics such as sales, earnings, cogs, stock price, and market sector. We then scraped the data using BeautifulSoup library in Python and turned that into a CSV file. After getting the data, our main goal is to analyze and model this data to better improve projections for a company’s future metrics, like earnings. 3.2 Variables The main variables that are used in this project are defined below: Variable Meaning YEAR The financial year of the company COMPANY The company’s stock abbreviation symbol MARKET.CAP The total market capitalization of the company (Volume * Price) EARNINGS The earnings in dollars for the previous year for the given company SALES How much the company sold in dollars last year CASH How much cash the company has in dollars at the end of the previous year Name The full name of the company Sector The name of the sector that the company is a part of Earnings_next_year The amount of money in dollars that the company earns in the following year 3.3 Initial Explorations "],["modeling.html", "Chapter 4 Modeling", " Chapter 4 Modeling "],["finalmodel.html", "Chapter 5 Final Model", " Chapter 5 Final Model "],["reflection.html", "Chapter 6 Reflection 6.1 Next Steps 6.2 Acknowledgements 6.3 Citations", " Chapter 6 Reflection 6.1 Next Steps 6.2 Acknowledgements 6.3 Citations "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
